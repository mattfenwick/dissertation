\section{NMR-Star library}
NMR-Star is the file format used by the BMRB \cite{bmrb} for archival of
NMR data.  As such data is useful for further studies, and archiving
data in the BMRB is the primary means of dissemination, it is important
to be able to work with NMR-Star files.

This library facilitates reproducibility by providing a robust interface
for working with NMR-Star files.  It allows both the creation of NMR-Star 
files as well as extraction of data -- for further querying -- of existing
files.  It is used by the previously mentioned Sparky extension.

To handle these files, a library was implemented both in Java 
\cite{fenwick2013} and in Python.  This library provides capabilities both
for reading and for writing NMR-Star files.  Although several tools for
dealing with NMR-Star files had already been implemented \cite{ccpn, bmrb},
there are several attributes of this library which set it apart:
\begin{itemize}
  \item error reporting of illegal input.  When malformed input is encountered,
    a useful, location-specific error is reported which includes sufficient
    information to quickly pinpoint and diagnose the problem.
  \item complete, standards-compliant NMR-Star syntax definition.
  \item open source under the MIT license.  This allows other interested 
    developers to peruse the source code to gain ideas, use the library in
    new applications, and modify and extend the library to fix problems or
    add new features if necessary.
  \item low coupling.  As a simple library, in order to use it, the library
    is simply imported using standard language facilities in order to use
    it through its programmatic API.  It does not require any external tools
    or dependencies, reducing the barrier to setup and installation.  It does
    not require learning to use additional tools or languages, merely the 
    host language; it takes advantage of the native facilities for abstraction
    and composition provided by the host language.
  \item high cohesion.  The library provides a simple, focused interface.
    This means it is easy to learn and use because it only deals with parsing
    the concrete syntax of NMR-Star files.
\end{itemize}
The library is freely available online (
