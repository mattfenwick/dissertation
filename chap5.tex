\section{Sparky extension}

\section{NMRPyStar}
 - read and write NMR-Star files
 - reference the paper
 - available in Java and Python
 - what sets it apart from other NMR-Star parsing libraries:
   - low coupling
     - usable as a simple library
     - no external tools
     - no hard dependencies
   - open source
   - high cohesion
   - error reporting
   - syntax definition
 - availability
 - enables pulling data from NMR-Star files, as well as creating them.
   why is that useful?
 - how does it facilitate reproducibility?
   - NMR data gets archived by the BMRB
   - this tool helps to put data into the BMRB (and pull it out)
   - also used by the Sparky reproducibility extension

\section{Connjur: ST and WB}

\section{Sample Scheduler}
 - reference the PNAS paper
 - data model: non-uniformity:
   - grid points
   - quadrature
   - transients
 - algorithms
   - literature search
 - how does it facilitate reproducibility?
   - captures parameters
   - integrates many algorithms in one tool, ensuring consistency
     and uniformity

\section{Discussion and conclusions}
