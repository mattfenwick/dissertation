\chapter{Problem: NMR Analysis is Irreproducible}

\section{Missing data and its role in analysis}
% need to cover what the data is, how it plays a role in NMR analysis, 
% why it's important to capture
The key deficiencies causing irreproducibility are missing primary data and 
meta data which are modeled neither in the CCPN data model nor in the 
NMR-STAR data dictionary, and are not archived and disseminated.
In other words, these data form an important piece of the analysis process,
but are not captured as concrete data in the data set.
Spectral analysis, including peak picking, GSS construction, GSS and resonance
typing, sequential GSS assignment, and sequence-specific GSS assignment is 
accomplished using a step-by-step process of deductive reasoning 
which is often augmented by computational tools.  The computational 
results may be subject to manual validation, correction, and extension
\cite{guerry2011automated}.  This section will explore the various types
of data involved.
