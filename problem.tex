\chapter{Problem: NMR Analysis is Irreproducible}

NMR analysis is irreproducible because the analysis process is not captured
in full.  For an overview of the analysis process, see \cite{guerry2011automated,
guntert2009automated, williamson2009automated}.  Briefly, a sequential process
is used, which may include the use of computational tools; manual modifications
are usually included as well, in order to validate, correct, and extend
computational analysis \cite{guerry2011automated, guntert2009automated, 
williamson2009automated}.  The manual interventions are necessary to get high-quality
results.

\section{What is missing?}
What necessary information is not captured from the analysis process?
\begin{itemize}
  \item what was done -- the tools that were used, their inputs and outputs,
    manual interventions
  
  \item the state of the analysis at each point during the process.
  
  \item why changes were made
  
  \item possible alternative interpretations
  
  \item issues with analysis -- problems, concerns, ambiguities, uncertainties,
    and incompletions
\end{itemize}
