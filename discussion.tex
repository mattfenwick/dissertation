\section{Significance to NMR}
This reproducible approach allows higher quality analysis of NMR data with
reduced mistakes.  It also enables more efficient analysis in terms of time
and effort, while increasing the effectiveness of teaching NMR to newcomers.



\section{Significance to general scientific data analysis}
The approach of capturing intermediate snapshots can be applied to other
fields as well.



\section{Significance to data systems}
Append-only and value-oriented databases are increasingly common.  These systems
are also useful for dealing with issues caused by scaling and concurrency.



\section{Future directions}
Expand the library of deductive reasoning, address issues preventing more
widespread use of the reproducibility strategy and tools, and increase the
number of scientists using reproducible approaches to analysis.
