Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a technique for studying 
biological molecules such as proteins at the atomic level.  
The information obtained from NMR is used to identify 
binding partners, locate active sites and binding pockets, and obtain 
structural and dynamics information which can be used in drug design.  In 
order to study molecules using NMR, an NMR spectrometer is used to collect 
free-induction decay (FID) data sets from a pure, high-concentration sample 
of the molecule(s) of interest.  In subsequent analysis, the FID data is 
processed to frequency-domain spectra, which are then analyzed to find peaks 
and assign the peaks to specific nuclei in the molecule, in a process known as 
chemical shift assignment.  The typical process makes use of automated tools to 
speed up simple and tedious tasks where possible, but relies upon manual 
analysis for complicated and difficult cases.  Spectroscopists use a deductive 
strategy of iteratively applying previously identified rules to make analyses 
of specific cases.  Ambiguous cases are noted and deferred, or the highest 
probability interpretation is made.  Following chemical shift assignment, 
Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) spectra are peak picked and assigned, and 
finally a structure is calculated and refined.  
During the analysis process, large amounts of data and meta data are generated.  
However, much of this is not recorded and thus does not show up in archives 
such as the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB).
This raises serious 
reproducibility concerns, since the data and meta data describing how the 
analysis was carried out are lost.  These concerns lead to practical issues,
including how to collaborate when data is missing, how to efficiently identify 
and correct errors, and how to augment previous analysis with new data.
The growing problems caused by irreproducibility in science have been noted 
recently.  The main contribution of this project is a definition of 
reproducibility within protein NMR, a strategy for rendering NMR analysis 
reproducible, a software implementation to enable reproducible analysis, a 
means for sharing reproducible data sets through a public archive, and a data 
set analyzed using fully reproducible means.
