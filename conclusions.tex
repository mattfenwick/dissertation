Reproducibility is important
Reproducibility makes biases explicit

NMR is difficult
NMR needs reproducibility in order to keep improving
There are several inherent problems for NMR (molecule size, obtaining pure and high-concentration samples).
There are also several incidental problems caused by irreproducibility.
Reproducibility allows us to focus on the inherent problems and make faster progress with them.
It is important to be able to effectively pass on knowledge to new students.
It is also important to be able to recognize, understand, and address the problems in the field of NMR.

Irreproducibility is potentially dangerous
% where are we going? how will we get there?

Open source scientific software is important for reproducibility
