\chapter{Conclusions}

Reproducibility is important to science.  Irreproducible results can not be 
trusted, and can not be built upon to make further discoveries.
On the other hand, reproducible science facilitates further progress because
the process is fully documented, and makes biases and problems with the process
possible to identify and mitigate in future work.

NMR data analysis is difficult.  An inherent problem is that data collected 
for many molecules is incomplete, ambiguous, and confused with false signals.
NMR data analysis is also irreproducible.
It is difficult to build on irreproducible analysis processes.
Reproducibility allows us to focus on the inherent problems and make faster progress with them.
There are also several incidental problems caused by irreproducibility.
It is important to be able to effectively pass on knowledge to new students.
It is also important to be able to recognize, understand, and address the problems in the field of NMR.
Rendering this reproducible provides a means for the field to keep improving.

Irreproducibility is potentially dangerous
% where are we going? how will we get there?

Open source scientific software is important for reproducibility
