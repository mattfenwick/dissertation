    Reproducibility is critical to science.
    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a technique for studying 
    biological molecules such as proteins at the atomic level.
    However, NMR analysis is irreproducible.
    This thesis defines reproducibility, shows how NMR analysis fails to
    meet the requirements for reproducibility, provides an approach for analysis
    which is reproducible, and presents the results of applying to approach to
    analyzing data from a real protein.
